# Self-Portrait Assignment

Going into this assignment, I was well aware that I'm not the best at translating real life objects to paper (or code). I wanted to focus on playing around with Processing (rather than spend time being reminded I cannot draw) so I decided to use a video game avatar as a reference. 


played around with arc() for a bit, angles were a bit hard to figure out so went to bezier()
