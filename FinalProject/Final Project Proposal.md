### Communication and Components

#### Arduino

I expect the Arduino to take 5 inputs: 4 digital (from momentary switches), and 1 analog (most likely a potentiometer) and send these to Processing. The switches will be used to control the direction Pac-Man travels in (up, down, left, right), while the potentiometer will control the speed of all moving characters, i.e. Pac-Man and the ghosts.

#### Processing

The Processing program should be significantly more complex: I anticipate that in addition to receiving the 5 inputs from Arduino, my program will also create a graphical game display providing instant feedback to users, handle the instantiation of all assets, check win/loss conditions, and handle scoring.
