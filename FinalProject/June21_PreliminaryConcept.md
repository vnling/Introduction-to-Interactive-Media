# Preliminary Concept for Final Project

For the final project, I'm thinking of building more upon my Pac-Man game in the midterm. Improvements/modifications I have in mind include:

1. Incorporating Arduino into the project. This would most likely involve adding four switches to control Pac-Man's direction. I'm also considering adding a potentiometer, so the player would be able to control the speed of Pac-Man and the ghosts.
2. Adding powerups, allowing Pac-Man to "eat" the ghosts, forcing them to respawn.
3. Adding fruits as in the original game as bonus point items.
4. (Possibly, time willing) adding walls to the game, limiting both Pac-Man and the ghosts to certain movements. This would also entail changing certain features of their movements, such as making them stop when they hit obstacles rather than bouncing off.
